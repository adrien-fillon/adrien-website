We ‎tested whether the theory that “bad is freer than good” would apply to the side-effect effect. In ‎two experiments (overall N = 1520), we replicated the side-effect effect and extended to ‎attributions of intentionality and causality (Study 1: d = 0.61-1.75; Study 2: d = 0.58-1.77). We ‎extended the side-effect effect to free will attributions and found a strong correlation between ‎blame/praise and free will attributions, even when controlling for intent and causality. We also ‎found that the attribution of blame was stronger in indeterministic than in deterministic ‎universes and the difference was lower for praise. We did not find support for a link between ‎blame, free will, and regret and discuss the possible investigation in this direction. Overall, our ‎study supports the idea that “blame is freer than praise”. Materials, data, and code: ‎https://osf.io/w8u39/?view\_only=2bcb71a7d729491ebdde08d3fe880477},

After more than 15 years of research, uncertainties remain as to the effectiveness of experimental procedures set up in vicarious dissonance to obtain effects, raising the need for a meta-analytic summary of the literature. In this registered report, we conducted a meta-analysis (k = [X], n = [X]) of the effect of vicarious dissonance. We found [empirical support] for the vicarious dissonance effect, [g = X]. Vicarious dissonance is a meaningful effect for [X]. Study heterogeneity was [Low/high]. [Summarize results]. We tested [List of moderators].

	abstract = {The “But you are free...” (BYAF) technique is a well-known technique from commitment theory and reactance theory, with the addition of these little terms leading to higher compliance to confederates to, for example, give spare for the bus. In this pre-registered meta-analysis, we examine the effect of the BYAF technique in 52 studies (N = 28759). An analysis of 74 effect sizes showed medium effect (g = 0.44, 95\% confidence intervals (CI) [0.36, 0.51]) for the BYAF technique. A moderator analysis found an effect stronger for Face-to-face interactivity over others. All the other moderators we used were non-significant, given too few studies involved in one condition. We did not find any differences between articles published before and after Carpenter’s (2013) meta-analysis. Finally, we found several limitations. Most recent studies on the subject are too low-powered, there are some possibilities of publication bias, and recent research questioned the theoretical foundations. We propose some improvements to the design, experiments, and commitment theory to ensure the effects found in the literature exist and are replicable.

On one side, they showed that individual differences play a role in group and team creativity. On the other side, they showed that group creativity activities have different characteristics, leading to numerous ways to assess effectiveness of creative activity. Nonetheless, no meta-analysis was performed on the relationship between the characteristics of the creative activity and individual differences. In this Registered Report, we conducted a meta-analysis (k = [XXX; number of studies/datasets]) on the relationship between personal factors and group creative activities characteristics (N = [XXXX]).

	abstract = {Self-interest is a central driver of attitudes and behaviors, but people also act against their immediate self-interest through prosocial behaviors, voting incongruously with their finances, or punishing others at personal cost. How much people believe that self-interest causes attitudes and behaviors is important, because this belief may shape regulation, shared narratives, and institutional structures. An influential paper claimed that people overestimate the power of self-interest on others’ attitudes and behavioral intentions (Miller \& Ratner, 1998). We present two registered, close, and successful replications (U.S. MTurk, N = 800; U.K. Prolific, N = 799) that compared actual to estimated intentions, with open data and code. Consistent with the original article, participants overestimated the impact of payment on blood donation in Study 1, ds = 0.59 [0.51, 0.66], 0.57 [0.49, 0.64], and overestimated the importance of smoking status for smoking policy preferences in Study 4, ds = 0.75 [0.59, 0.90], 0.84 [0.73, 0.96]. These replications included two extensions: 1) communal orientation as a moderator of overestimation and 2) a more detailed measure of self-interest in Study 4 (ordinal smoking status). Communal orientation did not predict overestimation, and the ordinal smoking measure yielded similar results to the main study. Verifying the overestimation error informs behavioral theories across several fields and has practical implications for institutions that require trust and cooperation.

	abstract = {People experience stronger regret regarding negative outcomes resulting from more exceptional circumstances compared to routine. We hypothesized that the exceptionality-routine attribution asymmetry would extend to attributions of agency and moral responsibility. In Experiment 1 (N = 337), we found that people attributed more free will to exceptional behavior compared to routine when the exception was due to self-choice rather than external circumstances. In Experiment 2 (N= 561), we replicated and generalized this effect to other scenarios, with support for the classic exceptionality effect regarding regret, and an extension to moral responsibility. In Experiment 3 (N = 128), we replicated these effects in a within-subject design. When using a classic experimental philosophy paradigm contrasting a deterministic and an indeterministic universe, we found that the results were robust across both contexts. We conclude that there is consistent support for a link between exceptionality and free will attributions. All materials, data, and code are available here: https://osf.io/f2pck/},

In a preregistered experiment conducted via the Prolific platform among French adults (N = 477), we replicated Experiments 2, 3 and 4 in Adams and colleagues (2021)’s study. We replicated the overlooking of subtraction, as participants generated 1155 additive ideas and only 297 subtractive ideas. Cueing participants (“Remember that you can add things or take them away”) increased the percentage who generated at least one subtractive idea (overall OR = 2.52, improvement condition, ϕ = 0.18, make-it-worse condition, ϕ = 0.24).Results therefore provided empirical support for the overlooking of subtractive changes hypothesis. We also found that norms affected the generation of new ideas (descriptive OR = 7.49, injunctive OR = 6.86). Cues and injunctive (but not descriptive) norms were both related to the asymmetry.},
